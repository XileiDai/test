class asyncify:

    Decorator to convert a synchronous method to asynchronous
    by running it in a separate thread.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        import asyncio

        @asyncify()
        def blocking_function(x):
            # Simulate a blocking operation
            time.sleep(x)
            return x

        async def main():
            result = await blocking_function(1)
            print(result)

        asyncio.run(main())

    In this example, `blocking_function` is wrapped by `asyncify`, 
    making it possible to use `await` with it in an asynchronous environment.

        Initializes the `asyncify` decorator with an optional event loop and executor.

        :param loop: 
            The event loop where the asynchronous execution will be scheduled. If not provided, the
            default event loop for the current thread is used. This parameter allows the user to specify
            a different event loop if needed, which is useful in applications running multiple event loops.
        :param executor: 
            The executor in which the synchronous function will be run. If not provided, the default
            executor of the event loop is used, which is usually a thread pool executor. This allows
            for customization of how the function is executed, for example, by using a process pool
            executor for CPU-bound tasks.

        Wraps a function to make it asynchronous by running it in a separate thread.

        This method is called when `asyncify` is used as a decorator. It wraps the provided synchronous function
        in an asynchronous function that, when called, schedules the synchronous function to be executed in a
        separate thread using the event loop's executor.

        :param func: The synchronous function to be converted into an asynchronous function.
        :return: An asynchronous version of the `func` which, when called, returns a future representing the
                 execution of `func` in a separate thread.
